Emotion Recognition and Deep Learning Techniques for Recognizing Emotions have been the subject of several studies and study. In the future, a model like this that is considerably more reliable and has endless possibilities in all disciplines will be necessary. This project attempted to solve emotion recognition difficulties using the inception net. Various databases have been investigated, with Kaggle's and JONATHAN OHEIX Emotional Faces serving as datasets for the study. The model is trained using Tensor Flow. It is possible to reach a 72 percent accuracy rate. A similar framework could be used to produce real-time emotion recognition in the future.

Different training and testing datasets were used to test the system. This test was carried out to see if the system could accurately predict results. Throughout the
development phase of the system, our system was thoroughly tested. Following the completion of separate modules, the modules were integrated to form a full system.
The system was then put to the test to see if the prediction made by the training dataset for the testing set was right. We attempted to get the highest level of
accuracy possible. After a couple of days of integration testing, our system's average accuracy was 70 + percent.
